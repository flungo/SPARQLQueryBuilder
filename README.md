SPARQLQueryBuilder
==================

Library to help build nice, neat SPARQL queries in an object-oriented fashion.

This library is designed to:
* Make writing SPARQL queries simple
* Minimise errors when writing SPARQL queries
* Make Java code where defining a SPARQL query neat and readable
* Include re-usable objects that can be used over multiple queries to save time

This is currently an undocumented work in progress, more detail will be comming soon about how to use. If you are interested in contributing then please contact me.
